What is npm?
Commnd: npm init ---creates a package.json
It is not a Node Package Manager it has no abbreviation it is just a pacakge manager, it manages all packages we use in our App
Use npm init to get npm to our APP

what is Package.json?
when we install or get npm into our app it will create a package.json file which has all details of dependencies and packages
that we use in our app example versions on all packages their detials etc...

3 types of bundler -- Webpack, Parcel, Vite

package.lock.json:
it keeps exact version of parcel

Transitive Dependencies:
Dependency having one more dependency , which has one more dependency and goes on
ex: our project is dependend on Parcel and it depends on lot of other things

we don't push it to prod server, coz we can generate all node modules with package.json and package-lock.json
coz, they have all exact versions
we can also use npm install to install node modules.
